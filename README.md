A final project for an Advanced Machine and Deep Learning course.
My partner and I searched online and downloaded a gender-classified dataset of images of handwriting from [IAM Handwriting Database](https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/).
Using various types of deep learning models, such as CNN, InceptionV3 and VGG16 we aimed to classify the data.
Our analysis involved the comparison of these models' performances as well as other hyperparameters.
We also took the challenge of generating images of each gender's handwriting. For that we used pixelCNN and GANs.
